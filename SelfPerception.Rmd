## Introduction

In general the dataset offers a lot of questions focusing on the use, general behaviour and perception of social media by parents and their kids between the age of 13 and 17 years.

The previous research was mainly focusing on quite "straight forward" approaches, leading to already interesting results. Therefore the following will focus on a more descriptive and bottom down approach. 

Social media like Facebook or Instagram provide a platform that enables people to engage and participate in social activities in a way that is close to the normal social spectrum and furthermore increase the reach of every person to the limits of number of users. 

This imposes new challenges for each individual, like defining a close network of peers, differentiating between online and real world relationships - if there is any difference. But one of the most interesting questions is, “How does social media change the way we perceive ourselves, enabling us to benchmark against more than 1bn different people, compared to the wider circle of acquaintances 15 years ago?”

According to Huffington Post Article there has been research conducted how Facebook has significant impact on our feelings as well as how our personality is reflected in certain behavioural patterns on social media. ([Article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-perpetua-neo/does-facebook-make-you-de_b_8474654.html))

Given this, it seems logic to infer that the higher the exposure to social media, the higher the impact on feelings and in consequences on self-perception. Defining a variable to measure "exposure" especially not just expressed as hours spent on Facebook, but also how emotionally people might be engaged to their own social media network, seems to be tricky. Generally the quality or value added of all networks is strongly relying on members of the network, in this case this would be number of friends a person has on a certain social media platform.

The basic assumption therefore is, that the number of friends should have a significant impact on the perceived value added of social media for each individual, therefore should have a positively correlating impact on exposure (the higher perceived value, the more time online and therefore the more exposure) and based on the assumptions stated in the article, this should have an impact on feelings and self-perception.

Hypothesis: "The number of friends on Facebook resp. followers on Instagram, has a significant impact on the perceived value added of social media and consequently about the own life".

This hypothesis was amended due to findings during the analysis for the following reason. The set of 5 questions, at least in part require a certain capability of self-reflection, emotional intelligence and general maturity. 
1. In general, does social media make you feel more connected to information about what’s going on in your friend’s lives?
2. In general, does social media make you feel worse about your own life because of what you see from other friends on social media?
3. In general, does social media make you feel better connected to your friends feelings?
4. In general, does social media make you feel pressure to post content that will be popular and get lots of comments or likes?
5. In general, does social media make you feel pressure to only post content that makes you look good to others?

Especially question 4 and 5 support this assumption. Therefore the hypothesis was amended to the following.

Hypothesis: "The age and the number of friends on Facebook resp. followers on Instagram, have a significant impact on the perceived value added of social media and consequently about the own life".

Given the holistic nature of the question the following description will predominantly focus on the approach and the rational behind certain decisions.

Prior to the explanation of the initial approach, the following steps need to be carried out.

}



```

Besides the standardised global cleaning, which was done centrally for the purpose of the following analysis, there needs to be done further cleaning for the following reason:

The survey assumes different media channels as "social media". With regards to the hypothesis not all considered media channel by the survey are accurate or applicable e.g. WhatsApp is predominantly a peer-to-peer instant messenger service and doesn´t fulfil the criteria of social exposure within the network. Therefore, in the following the Facebook and Instagram are summarised as social media. 

Besides cleaning out not valid responses to all examined questions, all respondents have to be removed that are neither using Facebook nor Instagram. This means that all responses that are considered to be valid for this analysis must have cumulated valid responses to the research questions and have to be at least present in one of the networks.

This cleaning is crucial for the validity of later results, but unfortunately decreases the number of responses from initially <b>`r nrow(teensdata)`</b> to a final of <b>`r nrow(perception)`</b> . In general the comparably small number of responses in the survey, needs to be kept in mind at all times.





    
#Clustering

The cleaned data set is now ready to be clustered. The selection of Facebook and Instagram as representative networks follows the rational of reciprocity, size, primary way of communication as well as popularity.

Reciprocity:
Reciprocal: The connection between members of Facebook (friends) are exclusively reciprocal and need to be requested/approved individually. Therefore there is no mismatch between people be able accessing own vs. accessing other peoples information/posts.

Non-reciprocal: Instagram and Twitter offer non-reciprocal relationships, that can lead to significant mismatches between the information streams. Extreme examples of these patterns can be seen with celebrity profiles, sometime following 200 profiles, but being followed by several million people.

Size: Facebook as well as Instagram are both extremely popular and established networks. Facebook, as the game changer in the early 2000s and Instagram as the innovator, predominantly moving communication from text to picture based. Based on the non-reciprocal character and picture-based communication, Instagram is extremely interesting with regards to exposure and subtle messages, pictures are more capable of including that written messages.

Based on this logic, every respondent has an assigned 33% tercile with 3 being highest 1 lowest, based on the individual number of friends for Facebook and follower on Instagram.

This seems to be in line with the hypothesis, since it can be concluded that respondents with a comparably higher number of friends/followers have comparably higher exposure to the network and therefore might have different views on certain things, like perception of other or pressure to post content.

var_perceptionKFR11_H<- var(perception$KFR11_H)

var_usage_media<- data.frame()
for(j in 1:3)
{
  var_usage_media[j,1]<- var(FbIn[FbIn[,8]== j,"KFR11_H"])
  var_usage_media[j,2]<- var(perception[perception[,8]== j,"KFR11_H"] , na.rm = TRUE)
  var_usage_media[j,3]<- var(FbIn[FbIn[,10]== j,"KFR11_H"])
  var_usage_media[j,4]<- var(perception[perception[,10]== j,"KFR11_H"], na.rm = TRUE)
}
colnames(var_usage_media)<- c("Facebook_Sub","Facebook_Total", "Instagram_Sub", "Instagram_Total")

# Generally the data of the subset and the set is moving in same direction with almost equal values
# While the medium tercile has a stronger variance compared to the others

```
#Evaluation of usage

To ensure the comparability of the different subsets clustered by tercile, limited analysis was conducted based on frequency of usage. The following assumptions were done:

People with an account in both networks can be considered to be the most exposed individuals in the set. Therefore the variance of logins within this subset was compared to the variance of logins in the entire data set among the different clusters. Due to the "either or"" decision with regards to representation in the networks, the correlation between belonging to same cluster in the two different networks could only be conducted in the subset.


There is a moderate correlation with: <b>`r cor_FbIn`</b>

The frequency of usage was measured by question KFR11_H

How often do you spend time with friends posting on social media sites? 1.Every day, 2.Every few days, 3. Less often, 4. Never

The variance of logins in the set is <b>`r var_perceptionKFR11_H`</b>, in the subset <b>`r var_FbInKFR11_H`</b>, which leaves to the conclusion that logins of respondents with no clustering by tercile vary equally among the different sets.

As shown below, the variance of logins varies stronger over the different clusters in the set compared to the subset, while Instagram has almost equally variation of logins.

```


#Excursion

As initially mentioned many conclusions relevant for the final approach, evolved during the first approach of analysing the data. After cleaning the data and clustering it, a visual analysis for assumed patterns was conducted with so called heat maps. As mentioned the observed correlation based on the clustering would have been expected to be much clearer, even though some weak patterns, proving the initial thought could be observed, like respondents from cohort 3 feel in general more connected to information than others. Furthermore most of the respondents stating that they "feel worse about their lives" considered themselves to be highly connected to information.


How do responses vary among the clusters by tercile?
```{r, echo = FALSE,fig.align = "center", fig.width= 10, fig.height= 8}

#create first plot based on cluster 
y<-count(perception[!is.na(perception[,"KFB1A"]),], vars = c(as.character("KFSNS1_A"),"KFB1A"))
 for(i in 1:nrow(y)){y[i,"KFSNS1_A"]<- as.character(y[i,"KFSNS1_A"])}
ggplot(y, aes(x = KFSNS1_A, y = KFB1A, fill = freq)) + geom_tile() + scale_fill_gradient(low = "white",   high = "steelblue") + 
  geom_text(data=y, aes(KFSNS1_A, KFB1A, label = freq), color="black", size=rel(5))+
  labs(x = "KFSNS1_A: Feel connected to information", y = "tercile by Facebook friends", title = "")+
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("1"="Yes a lot", "2"="Yes,  a little ","3"="No"))
```

How do questions access to information and perceived of own life correlate?
```{r, echo = FALSE,fig.align = "center", fig.width= 10, fig.height= 8}
#create second plot question/question
y1<-count(perception[!is.na(perception[,"KFB1A"]),], vars = c(as.character("KFSNS1_A"),"KFSNS1_B"))
 for(i in 1:nrow(y1)){
 y1[i,"KFSNS1_A"]<- as.character(y1[i,"KFSNS1_A"]) 
 y1[i,"KFSNS1_B"]<- as.character(y1[i,"KFSNS1_B"])}

ggplot(y1, aes(x = KFSNS1_A, y = KFSNS1_B, fill = freq)) + geom_tile() + scale_fill_gradient(low = "white",   high = "steelblue") + 
  geom_text(data=y1, aes(KFSNS1_A, KFSNS1_B, label = freq), color="black", size=rel(5))+
  labs(x = "KFSNS1_A: Feel connected to information", y = "KFSNS1_B: Feel bad about life", title = "")+
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("1"="Yes a lot", "2"="Yes,  a little ","3"="No"))+
  scale_y_discrete(labels = c("1"="Yes a lot", "2"="Yes,  a little ","3"="No"))

```


<b>Conclusion:</b>

The heat maps do neither indicate any significant relationships between the number of friends on Facebook, nor the perceived mood (feeling bad about live) with perceived value added of the network (feel connected to information).

Especially the "Yes a little" received comparably high results, which might be due to the "neither nor" character of the answer. Based on these observations, the following two conclusions were drawn:


- The results are not supporting the initially logical assumptions based on the mentioned research strong enough, but on the other hand the observations are too weak to allow rejecting the hypothesis
- The complexity and intimacy of some questions might increase the likelihood of answering with a more or less perceived neutral answer like the "Yes a little". Especially the intimate questions like

KFSNS1_B: In general, does social media make you feel worse about your own life because of what you see from other friends on social media?
KFSNS1_D: In general, does social media make you feel pressure to post content that will be popular and get lots of comments or likes?
KFSNS1_E: In general, does social media make you feel pressure to only post content that makes you look good to others?

receive comparably high negative or indifferent responses. Given the initial thoughts, this might be due to the age of the participants and there mentioned emotional capabilities. To evaluate whether the age has an impact on the way of responding to the dataset was re-clustered by age.

#Clustering by age

The following results are solely clustered by age, regardless of the tercile for the networks. This was done to look at the impact of age on the results in an isolated way.

The table shows all correlation for all different unique combination of questions per age cohort. It can be observed that the correlation for the same combination of questions slightly vary among the different cohorts. With <b>`r nrow(perception[perception[,"Child_age"]== 13,]) ` </b>,<b>`r nrow(perception[perception[,"Child_age"]== 14,]) ` </b>,<b>`r nrow(perception[perception[,"Child_age"]== 15,]) ` </b>,<b>`r nrow(perception[perception[,"Child_age"]== 16,]) ` </b> and <b>`r nrow(perception[perception[,"Child_age"]== 17,]) ` </b> the respondents are more or less evenly distributed among the different ages (increasing order starting with 13). Therefore the observation can be assumed to be valid, with not too many variations due to the different sample sizes.



```{r, echo= FALSE , results=TRUE,fig.align = "center", fig.width= 10}
kable(cor_plot_age)
```

The plot confirms the previous observation of varying correlations over the different cohorts for the same pair of question. Looking at question pair <b>KFSNS1_D / KFSNS1_E</b> within cohort 13, its interesting to observe that there is a outstanding high correlation for this pair and only in this cohort(displayed in table above). This might be due to two contradictive assumptions. Questions D as well as E are aiming almost in the exact same direction but slightly differently phrased. Therefore the two possibilities are that either the difference between the questions was not correctly perceived, or given the case that E is a control question for D, 13 year olds are more honest and responding the same way to equal questions.

```{r, echo= FALSE , message=FALSE ,fig.align = "center", fig.width= 10, fig.height= 8}

#final plot for age cor with questions
#1:5 is just for values excluding total results
rownames(cor_plot_age)<-cor_sub_rnames_break
cor_plot_age_t <- as.data.frame(t(cor_plot_age[,1:5]))
cor_plot_age_t_melt<-melt(cor_plot_age_t[,1:10])
colnames(cor_plot_age_t_melt)<-c("Question_combination", "Correlation")
#plot
ggplot(cor_plot_age_t_melt, aes(x = Question_combination, y = Correlation)) + 
  geom_boxplot(notch = FALSE,outlier.colour = "red", outlier.shape = 1)+
  ggtitle("Calculated correlations for individual\nquestion combination clustered by age")
```


## Clustering by age, tercile and network

Following the same logic as above, the analysis of correlations between different questions sets will be done based on a new clustering. The respondents are now clustered by their age, tercile of friends/followers and their responses split up by the two networks Facebook and Instagram.

#Information about the different cluster

The number of observations in each cluster is important with regards to the reliability of further conclusions based on this data set. 

<b>Occurrences:</b> Displays the number of all respondents that have an account in the corresponding network and cluster

<b>tercile:</b> Value 1 indicates that this cohort belongs to the lowest 10% quantile and therefore shouldn´t be considered due to the small sample size

#Correlation per cluster based on Facebook

Observations:

Highest correlation: The highest correlations can be observed for questions (A/C, B/E, D/E, B/C). Starting with the already mentioned unique combination of D/E, which are closely related questions the following can be concluded from the plot. Looking at all counter examples, so same first question matched with D and E, it becomes obvious that those questions with exception of (B/D, B/E) are more or less equally correlating with the opposite question. Also taking the observation of (D/E) into consideration, it appears to be a valid conclusion that the respondents perceive these two questions similarly.

The same accounts for the combination of (A/C) with both asking about the quality of connection to friends their feelings respectively.
Left with (B/E) this is most likely the most interesting question combination, looking at the correlation between feeling "worse about your own life because of what you see from other friends on social media" and feeling the pressure to "only post content that makes you look good to others". This observation is strongly in line with the initially presented research discussed by the ([Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-perpetua-neo/does-facebook-make-you-de_b_8474654.html)).

The last interesting observation with regards to the variance of the values is combination (B/C). The observations vary from positively to negatively correlating, which might be explained with the following assumption. Some people might perceive it positively to be connected to friend’s feelings, while other might get jealous and therefore absorb it as negative feeling.

#Correlation per cluster based on Instagram

In general the patterns follow the same patterns as observed with Facebook. Looking at the previously identified questions, it occurs that for (B/E) Instagram has slightly more extreme values but a weaker variance, while mean and median are almost equally with 0.44/0.43 and 0.477/0.49 respectively (Instagram first).

The situation for (B/C) is almost the same, with one extreme outlier having a negative correlation of -0.37 from the 15 year old with a lot of followers.

#Conclusion and limitations

Given the initial size of the entire set and the necessary cleaning, the cluster ended up being relatively small to make statistically significant observations. Furthermore the selected independent variables number of friends/followers and age must be evaluated under the following assumptions. Looking at dependent variables that are deeply connected to the psyche of human beings, given the age and the along going presumable changes in life of the respondents, using only these two variables is a strong reduction of complexity to explain highly connected and complex occurrences that are influenced by numerous factors. 
Second, given the time restriction and scope of the project a deeper analysis was simply not possible. The overall aim of this analysis was to show how clustering by relevant parameters might lead to different results and insights, which will be quickly recaptured.

Starting with the initial heat maps, that only had limited explanatory power, the clustering by tercile of friends and age let to more detailed and differentiated results, clearly showing that the correlations between the responses to the questions are also relying on the cluster criteria. Furthermore as discussed above, there is a correlation between feeling "worse about your own life because of what you see from other friends on social media" and feeling the pressure to "only post content that makes you look good to others". This observation addresses exactly what the author of the article initially describes with regards to her experience. Given the mentioned limitations regarding the dataset as well as the complexity of the human mind, the hypothesis must be rejected from a statistical point of view, nevertheless the observation showed as well, that exposure expressed in number of friends has an impact on the perception of social media.
